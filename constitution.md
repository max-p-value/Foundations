## I’m building for my personal freedom.

**Freedom to say what the fuck I want to say.**  
Freedom from gatekeepers — no begging for funding, promotions, permission, or praise.  
If the choice is to beg for approval or sell to a market.  
**I choose the market.**

---

## I will not:

- **Accept money with strings.**  
  No grants with deliverables. No investors who want control. No clients who buy obedience.

- **Depend on legacy approval.**  
  No chasing titles, grants, credibility, or legitimacy.  
  No peer review committees. No impact factors.

- **Be hireable.**  
  I sell products. I might clearly defined services at some point.  
  I will not sell *my time*.

- **Accrue external obligations.**  
  No debt. No work-for-hire that tethers me to someone else’s mission.  
  I chose my Internal obligations. I will not take on External leverage.

## I will:

- **Be multimodal.**  
  No single point of failure.  
  I’m building multiple revenue sources — content, products, services — across code, text, audio, video — about science, compute, and business.  
  I build while employed and investing for passive income.  
  I reduce my employment only as revenue grows.  
  *Power begets power — not fud.*

- **Be truth- and freedom-of-speech-oriented.**  
  I’m doing science. The first principle is truth.  
  I will say what I believe is true, even if it hurts me or others.  
  I will not punish people for truth or viewpoints.  
  I protect speech and inquiry by default.

- **Grow post-academic science.**  
  Academia betrayed its core: truth, fairness, merit, freedom.  
  Academic science is in decline. Gatekeepers throttle innovation. Truth is second to politics. Credentialism overrides competence. Peer review has become 
risk-averse groupthink.  
  I help build the counter-culture:  
  *truth-first, rigor-first, decentralized, build-what-works.*  
  Ownership, revenue, and sovereignty instead of tax-funded politics.  
  *Reputation last, not first.*  
  Academic careers are based on whose lab you visited.  
  Post-academia builds first — reputation is an afterthought.  
  No default credit for excellence markers like Nature papers or Harvard PhDs.

- **Build from a positive balance sheet.**  
  I start with $0. A laptop. Time. Drive.  
  Every dollar earned gets reinvested in the business.  
  I compound relentlessly across all modalities of the company portfolio.   
  My benchmark portfolio starts at 100% Bitcoin to give asymmetric upside.  
  Bitcoin growth is my hurdle rate. The business derisks and must outperform it.

- **Accept only clean funding.**  
  I apply for nonrefundable grants only if they compromise none of the principles above.
