## I’m building a startup for my personal freedom.

**Freedom to say what the fuck I want to say.**  
Freedom from gatekeepers — no politics. Just value creation and equity building.  

**I choose the free market over employment.**

---

## I will:

- **Be multimodal.**  
  No single point of failure.  
  I’m building multiple revenue sources — content, products, services — across code, text, audio, video — about science, compute, and business.  
  I build while employed and investing for passive income.  
  I reduce my employment as revenue grows.  
  *Power begets power — not fud.*

- **Be truth- and freedom-of-speech-oriented.**  
  I’m doing science. The first principle is truth.  
  I will say what I believe is true not what is currently politically correct or unoffensive enough for the most fragile. 
  I will not punish people for truth or viewpoints.  
  I protect speech and inquiry by default.

- **Grow post-academic science.**
  Academia betrayed its core: truth, fairness, merit, freedom.  
  Academic science is in decline. Gatekeepers throttle innovation. Truth is second to politics. Credentialism overrides competence. Peer review  
  has become risk-averse groupthink.  
  I help build the counter-culture — post-academia.  
  Science is changing. A growing number of people are disillusioned with academia and doing serious, high-quality work outside of universities.

  The core difference?  
  Legacy science is funded by institutions.  
  Post-academic science is funded by results.  

  I'll write more about this shift [in this blog post → link coming soon].

- **Build from a positive balance sheet.**  
  I start with $0. A laptop. Time. Drive.  
  Every dollar earned gets reinvested in the business until it can pay salaries robustly.  
  I compound relentlessly across all modalities of the company portfolio.   
  My benchmark portfolio starts at 100% Bitcoin to give asymmetric upside.  
  Bitcoin growth is my hurdle rate. The business derisks and must outperform it.

- **Accept only clean funding.**  
  I apply for nonrefundable grants and keep external obligations minimal

---

## I will not:

- **Accept money with strings.**  
  No grants with deliverables. No investors who want control. No clients who buy obedience.

- **Depend on legacy approval.**  
  No chasing titles, grants, credibility, or legitimacy.  
  No peer review committees. No impact factors.

- **Be hireable.**  
  I sell products. I might sell clearly defined services at some point.  
  I will not sell *my time*.

- **Accrue external obligations.**  
  No debt. No work-for-hire that tethers me to someone else’s mission.  
  I chose my Internal obligations. I will not take on External leverage.
