# Architecture

### Modular Architecture
The most foundational architectural principle is that each cell model is split into a large hierarchical system of submodules that act independently over short 
time intervals.  
Every partial model — whether of a process, pathway, or structure — can run on its own under simple assumptions about its environment.  
Inputs and outputs (e.g. molecular concentrations) are defined, and interlinking with other modules is suspended during time steps.  
This enables iterative improvements to each module independently and in parallel.

Long-term, the architecture is designed to scale toward composability of multiple cells in tissue contexts — but this is part of the broader moonshot and not a 
short-term requirement.

### Clocked Simulation Logic
The model will be clockable, i.e. the model time interval is flexible.  
Initially, all model parts calculate over the same time intervals.  
With increasing complexity, it might become useful to run different parts on different time intervals.  
This will be straightforward to implement due to modular independence.

### Differential Complexity
The model will allow running modular differential complexity for computational efficiency —  
not every process needs to be modeled at full complexity for every experiment to get meaningful results.

### Molecule vs. Object Abstraction
Not every water molecule needs to be modeled in its entire behavior.  
Rather, an object 'water' with a number of molecule concentrations will exist and update its characteristics at the clock interval.

### Classical vs. ML-Based Modeling
While I initially imagined a literal, classically-modeled system — with every molecule and process explicitly defined —  
I now see the potential of hybrid approaches with ML-based aspects.  
Classical modeling may have fatal flaws. ML-based systems will likely play a role.  
I will continuously learn and update accordingly.

### Defined Interfaces
- Inputs and outputs are molecular concentrations, compartmentalized if needed.  
- Assumptions start loose: infinite sinks/sources — until constrained by additional modules.  
- Predictions are tested, failures are traced, modules refined.  
- Each module refines the environment for others.  
- Mature components may be reduced in detail while preserving accuracy.
