# Whole-Cell Model Moonshot

This is an open framework for building molecule-complete models of human cells — modular, composable, and predictive enough to simulate real-world biology in 
silico.

It's a moonshot project and rooted in big optimism about technological progress and personal agency. If successful it could play a central role in biotech. I 
build independently, scalable, and from first principles. I know this is crazy but that’s ok.

## 📜 Project Overview

I aim to replace major parts of experimental biology with simulations. That starts with:

- Building modular process models  
- Connecting them via defined interfaces  
- Testing, refining, scaling  
- Enabling exponential complexity without sacrificing tractability  

Every part of this project is transparent and compounding — designed to grow organically from one process to a system.

- Mission — Why this matters and who it's for  
- Constitution — What I will and won’t do as I build  
- Philosophy — How I think about abstraction, fidelity, and complexity  
- Architecture — The structural principles and design logic of the model

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is a living project. Expect changes. Contributions are welcome soon. For now, I’m just building.
