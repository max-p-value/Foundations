Usefulness lies in the right level of abstraction.  
A perfect copy of reality is just reality — not a model.  
It’s computationally intractable, redundant, and ultimately unhelpful.  
The goal isn’t to replicate every molecule with atomic precision, but to simplify enough to retain predictive power while achieving feasibility.

The model starts small.  
One process.  
A modular unit with inputs, outputs, and a time interval.  
The modules are independent and composable. As I connect them, the system complexity increases, and constraints propagate.

Prediction failure is a heuristic to identify model inaccuracies and flag necessary improvements.  
Assessing what updated parameters improve predictive power refines the components over time.  
The system grows more accurate as complexity and fidelity scale with domain understanding and compute.

If the system becomes too complex, subsystems can be collapsed into efficient, lower-resolution approximations.  
Boolean, stochastic, or hybrid abstractions — detail can be traded for efficiency, but only when the cost is understood.

In a perfect world, a whole-cell model could become a foundational tool — a reference against which biology is tested and refined.  
False predictions would flag knowledge gaps.  
Model–literature alignment could even help assess the robustness of scientific claims.  
That’s the long arc: shifting biology from fragmented observations to integrated prediction.
