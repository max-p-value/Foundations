# Start Here

This project is called **Teleos**.

It’s an independent moonshot to build a **molecule-complete, modular, composable model of human cells** — starting small and scaling organically.

The first goal is a simulation of a human cell. A human cell is insanely complex and a **complete** model doesn’t exist yet but could be incredibly useful. The 
goal is **predictive power**, **usefulness**, **replacing wet-lab bottlenecks** with in silico biology, and most importantly exponential scaling.  
The second goal is to create a scalable business to replace my day job.

## 📄 Foundational Documents

Start with these if you want to understand the thinking behind it:

- [Mission](mission.md) – Why this matters and who it’s for  
- [Constitution](constitution.md) – What I will and won’t do while building  
- [Philosophy](philosophy.md) – How I think about abstraction and complexity  
- [Architecture](architecture.md) – The design logic of the system

## 🧪 What’s Being Built

This is a project in motion.  
Right now I’m sketching foundational code, modules, and writing down the high-level structure.  

If you're here early: don’t mind the raw feel — I’m building **direction**.

## 🏗️ How It’s Built

Modular. Composable. First-principles.  
No gatekeepers. No committee. No bullshit. Just momentum.
