What is the ultimate outcome?
A molecule-complete model of a human cell. A platform that enables in silico experiments — gene knockouts, drug perturbations, combinatorial interventions — with 
real predictive value.
This will save billions in R&D. It will make biotech faster, cheaper, and more scalable.

What beliefs drive this?
	•	Whole-cell models are feasible. Mycoplasma genitalium has already been modeled. From here, it’s only a matter of scaling.
	•	Usefulness precedes completeness. Even partial models can generate insight, IP, and revenue.
	•	Complexity can be modularized. Isolated components can function as valuable assets — scientific and commercial.
	•	The process creates value. The skills, infrastructure, and systems required to build these models are themselves monetizable — through IP, 
licensing, and services.
	•	This can scale from zero. Exponential growth through compounding is the key. Drive vision and a plan is all that’s required

Who is this for?
	•	Biotech & pharma. R&D costs are exploding. In silico models will be essential.
	•	Regulators & governments. Faster validation. Safer drugs. Less animal testing.
	•	The public. Science is tax-funded. This business makes science revenue-first and accountable.
	•	Builders & believers. The next generation of engineers of life

What values shape the work?
	•	Truth over consensus
	•	Independence over institutional approval
	•	Compounding across all modalities
	•	Healthspan maximization
	•	Curiosity, clarity, and courage

What pisses me off about being employed?
	•	Politics. Truth loses to ideology. Merit loses to obedience. Effort doesn’t beat orthodoxy.
In the current system, rewards are capped by how agreeable you are — not by what you build, know, or create. I’m done with that.

What excites me?
Everything about this.
	•	Owning my own platform
	•	Saying what the fuck I want to say
	•	No gatekeepers
	•	No performance reviews
	•	No politics for funding or credit
I build this for personal freedom and truth. To contribute to the counter culture and challenge academic legacy science.
And because this just might change how biology is done forever.
